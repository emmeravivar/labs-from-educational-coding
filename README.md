# labs-from-educational-coding

This repository gathers a collection of labs and code samples designed for hands-on learning of modern web development, both backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) and frontend (React, Vite). Each folder is an independent lab focused on a specific aspect of application development.

## Repository Structure

- **BLAB-1_lab-back-server-and-bbdd**: Basic backend template with Node.js and Express, connecting to MongoDB using Mongoose. Ideal for learning how to start a server and connect a database.
- **BLAB-2_lab-back-models-routing-controllers**: Introduction to MVC architecture in Node.js, with separation of models, controllers, and routes, using Express and Mongoose.
- **BLAB-3_lab-back-user-controler-create**: REST API for user management, with endpoints to create and list users, following the MVC pattern.
- **FLAB-0_react-boilerplate-application-with-components**: Educational React boilerplate, with modular structure, Babel and Webpack integration, and a sample car management application.
- **FLAB-1_lab-front-data-service**: React lab to learn how to consume public APIs using custom hooks with Fetch, Axios, and Async/Await.
- **FLAB-2_lab-front-data-serviceII**: Advanced practice for consuming REST APIs in React, including CRUD operations and comparison of different promise handling approaches and custom hooks.

## General Objective

The goal of this repository is to serve as a base for exercises and reference for students and self-learners who want to learn the fundamentals of modern web development, both frontend and backend, with practical and progressive examples.

Each lab includes its own README with detailed instructions, folder structure, and usage examples.
